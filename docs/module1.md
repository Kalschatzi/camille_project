# Module 1 - Algorithms and Datastructure
 Exercise: Study and document datastructures:
    ArrayList
    LinkedList
    Set
    HashMap
    Tree
        Binary tree
    Queue
    Stack

 How do these work and when should they be used?
 
* What is time complexity?
* What is the time complexity of searching if an element exists on each one of these data structure?


Create java code examples for each one of them.
