Camille Project

This repository is to showcase my programming skills journey.  I will begin with learning the foundational concepts of programmming, working up to more advance concepts in languages such as Java and Go.
Java is a great language to begin learning as it is object-oriented, widely used and incorporates great foundational concepts of programming.

**Ways of Working**

Projects will be moved from the Backlog and tickets worked on and reviewed weekly.
All tickets will require a review prior to merging.
This README will be updated in detail on each exercise as each area of the project is developed.
